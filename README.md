# Project Management

A web application designed to streamline project and task management within a team environment. It supports user registration, account confirmation, and role-based authentication, ensuring that access to certain actions is restricted or granted based on user roles.

Project managers have the ability to create projects, manage team members, update or delete tasks, and monitor task histories for progress tracking.

All users can update their profile, including changing their name, email, and password.

Team developers can complete tasks, change task statuses, and add notes. However, only the note creator can delete their own notes, and team developers are restricted from editing or deleting projects or tasks—these permissions are reserved exclusively for the project manager.

For security purposes, deleting a project requires the project manager to confirm their identity by entering the password of the account that created the project.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniel-pompa/project-management-system.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd project-management-system
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create an `.env` file in the root of the project and set the necessary environment variables. You can use the `.env.template` file as a reference.

5. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> The server will typically run on <http://localhost:5173>, but check the output on your terminal to be sure.

Now, you're all set to explore the system!

## Usage

Once the project is up and running, the application offers the following functionality:

1. **User Registration**:
   - Users can sign up, confirm their accounts via email, and log in to access the system.

2. **Role-Based Access**:
   - **Project Manager**: Can create projects, add or remove team members, assign and manage tasks, and view task histories.
   - **Team Developer**: Can complete tasks, update task statuses, add notes, and view project details.

3. **Task Management**:
   - Projects are divided into tasks, each with a status (pending, on hold, in progress, review, or completed) and a change history for tracking purposes.

4. **Note System**:
   - Team developers can add notes to tasks to provide updates. Notes can only be deleted by the user who created them.

5. **Collaboration Features**:
   - Project managers control team membership, while developers collaborate on task completion without the ability to modify projects or tasks directly.
